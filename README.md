## Background 

King James, The Chosen One, The Akron Hammer are just some of the "aka" names Lebron James has acquired over his 17-year career in the NBA. There is no questioning LeBron’s influence on the game today, with a staggering 10 trips to the NBA Finals with 8 of them being consecutive, also being the only player in NBA history to have won three NBA championships with three franchise as Finals MVP.  Tell me that isn’t a mouthful. I decided to embark on this project on comparing LeBron to some of the most influential players in the past and some who are still playing today to showcase my Tableau skills. Obviously there many players that we can compare Lebron to, but we are focused on impact. Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant (R.I.P), Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden are players who I feel have had similar influence on the game, but it’s debatable.

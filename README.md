Tell me that isn’t a mouthful. I decided to embark on this project on comparing LeBron to some of the most influential players in the past and some who are still playing today to showcase my Tableau skills. Obviously there many players that we can compare Lebron to, but we are focused on impact. Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant (R.I.P), Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, James Harden are players who I feel have had similar influence on the game, but it’s debatable.
